# Event Hub

This group project is a location-based event search engine. It will also show users the local time, weather, event location map, and link to purchase tickets for users to easily plan and attend events of their interests.

I was responsible for researching and implementing the event API and also assisted in the front end development.

Technologies Used: Bootstrap, APIs, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Moment.js, and Photoshop

# API Used

- Eventful API: to query event details based on search parameters
- OpenWeatherMaps API: to display weather information
- Google Maps API: for maps and directions
- TimeZoneDB API: to display time


# Live Demo
